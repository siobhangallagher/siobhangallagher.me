🌿 Siobhan Gallagher – My Website V2.0!

Hey there! 👋Welcome to the code behind my website: www.siobhangallagher.me

This project is now the home of my coding journey 🌱

💻 About This Project

This site was created from scratch - with lots of coffee - as a home for my coding journey and blog 'Studio Notes' using:

    🧱 HTML

    🎨 CSS

    ⚙️ JavaScript

It’s a space to introduce myself, share my passions, and start showcasing my journey into UI/UX design and front-end development.

    ✨ What I Learned

    Working on this project taught me heaps! Including:

    How to use Git to track changes

    How to push my project to GitHub and publish it using GitHub Pages 🚀

    Basic web structure, styling, and interactivity (I know WHAT I want to do, and now learing the HOW)

    That tiny code changes can make a big visual impact (and break everything 😂) — all part of the learning journey, right?

🔧 Tools I Used

    Visual Studio Code – to write, edit and preview my code

    Git + GitHub – to save and share my project

    Google Fonts + simple icons – to give the site a personal touch

    Lots of Google searches and chats with helpful AI assistants 💜

🗸 What’s Next?

This site is just the beginning! I plan to:

    Revise the UI (V2.1 is in the pipeline) ✍️

    Improve layout and responsiveness focussing on accessibility

    Learn more about JavaScript and explore React or other frameworks

    Keep experimenting and learning 🚀

🙌 A Big Thank You

Big appreciation to everyone cheering me on as I pivot into tech 💪
