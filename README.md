🌿 Siobhan Gallagher – My First Website!

Hey there! 👋Welcome to the code behind my very first website: www.siobhangallagher.me
This project is the beginning of my coding journey and growing portfolio 🌱

💻 About This Project

This site was created as part of the She Codes Basics course, which I completed in late December 2024. It’s my very first coding project 👏🏻 – a simple, static site that I designed and built from scratch using:

🧱 HTML

🎨 CSS

⚙️ JavaScript

It’s a space to introduce myself, share my passions, and start showcasing my journey into UI/UX design and front-end development.

✨ What I Learned

Working on this project taught me heaps! Including:

How to write and organise code in Visual Studio Code (I love the colour themes and live preview!)

How to use Git to track changes

How to push my project to GitHub and publish it using GitHub Pages 🚀

Basic web structure, styling, and interactivity

That tiny code changes can make a big visual impact (and break everything 😂) — all part of the learning journey, right?

🔧 Tools I Used

Visual Studio Code – to write, edit and preview my code

Git + GitHub – to save and share my project

Google Fonts + simple icons – to give the site a personal touch

Lots of Google searches and chats with helpful AI assistants 💜

🗸 What’s Next?

This site is just the beginning! I plan to:

Add a blog section ✍️

Showcase UI/UX projects and Figma prototypes

Improve layout, accessibility, and responsiveness

Learn more about JavaScript and explore React or other frameworks

Keep experimenting and learning 🚀

🙌 A Big Thank You

Thanks to She Codes, Matt Delac, and all the mentors who supported me through the basics course. Also big appreciation to everyone cheering me on as I pivot into tech 💪

Built with curiosity, caffeine ☕, and a love of learning.
